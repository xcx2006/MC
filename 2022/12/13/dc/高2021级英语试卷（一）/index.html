Mother lived longer and kept her mental sharpness until a few days before she died. Dad suffered from dementia(痴呆) probably for the last six months of his life. It’ s hard to say how long because his dear wife knew how to cover his forgetfulness or sometimes strange behavior up for him.<br>There were times, however, when mother became totally frustrated with the changes she saw taking place and she would blame him for doing things on purpose just to make her angry. He loved juicy fruit gum, but she kept it hidden from sight and rationed(定量供应) it because he could chew five or six sticks in an hour and ask for another package. “I have to watch him like a hawk.” she said.<br>Even though they lived in an assisted-living facility, my father would not bathe himself and would not let any staff person help him. So mother adjusted his shower temperature, washed his back, brought him a dry towel, and helped him dress. With her heart failure and the need for oxygen full time, this chore wore her out, both physically and emotionally. Then he started getting up in the middle of night. He would go into their bathroom, which was actually a part of their bedroom, turn on all the lights, and shave. Mother could not convince him to return to bed until he finished. As a result, mother couldn’ t get enough sleep at night.<br>I don’ t have any answers that might have made their last months together any easier. Since they were very private people, sometimes it was hard to know what was really going on. When I stopped by their place, mother would talk nonstop as usual and daddy would smile a lot, like what he used to do. I took along food they enjoyed to them, like smoothies or milkshakes. Mother loved orchids and they thrived under her care so she usually received one for any special occasion. Daddy would often let me brush his “angel hair”, as mother named it, and I might help her fasten jewelry<br>All of these little things were ways to say “I love you”, but we didn’ t often discuss some of the truly important issues related to my daddy’ s declining health. I tried to respect their privacy and treat them with the dignity they deserved. I think they both tried to protect me, their daughter.<br>I guess that’ s what parents do.<br>24.The writer didn’ t know much about her father’ s dementia, because<br>A. she didn’ t visit her parents much.<br>B. her father hid his conditions carefully.<br>C. her father’ s conditions weren’ t serious.<br>D. her mother kept her father’ s dementia a secret.<br>25. What the writer’ s mother said in Paragraph 2 shows that<br>A. her mother was very strict with her father<br>B. her mother had to pay full attention to her father<br>C. her father liked eating juicy fruit gum very much<br>D. her father often made her mother angry on purpose<br>26. Seeing her father smile a lot, the writer<br>A. found it unusual B. knew he was pretending<br>C. considered her father normal D. wanted to talk nonstop with him<br>27.

But such opportunities were becoming rarer due to the influence of climate change, the government agency, which has monitored the reef for 35 years, said in its annual report released today. “The increasing emergence of climate-related extreme weather events and starfish outbreaks is causing more severe and frequent pressures, giving the reef fewer opportunities like this to recover,” CEO Paul Hardisty said. The scientists surveyed 127 reef sites in 2021 and found hard coral cover had increased at 69 of the 81 locations surveyed in the past two years.<br>Separate scientific research released last October found the 2,300-kilometre(1,400 miles) system had lost half its corals since 1995, with a series of ocean heat waves causing mass coral death.<br>Britta Schaffelke, research program director at AIMS, said the latest findings provided a slight hope that the reef still has the power of recovering. But she added that its future is still very poor because of the dangers of climate change and other factors that are affecting the reef.<br>UNESCO has urged Australia to take urgent climate action but the government has long resisted calls to commit to net zero emissions by 2050.The government has said it hopes to meet the target“as soon as possible” without harming its economy, insisting dealing with climate change requires a global effort. The reef was worth about US $4.8 billion a year in tourism for the Australian economy and there are fears that an “in danger” listing could weaken its tourist appeal.<br>28.What is the major cause of the damage to the corals?<br>A. The climate change. B. Too many tourists.<br>C. Over development. D. Lack of money<br>29. What is mainly talked about in Paragraph 3?<br>A. The result of the survey. B. The efforts AIMS has made.<br>C. The slight chance of the recovery. D. The terrible situation of the climate.<br>30. What is Britta Schaffelke’ s attitude towards the future of the reef?<br>A. Indifferent. B. Positive. C. Intolerant. D. Anxious.<br>31. What can we infer from the last paragraph?<br>A. Australia wants to put the reef on the endangered list.<br>B. The Australian government has ignored UNESCO’ s demand.<br>C. Australia hopes to keep a balance between emission target and its economy.<br>D. The Australian government refuses to take its share of responsibility of climate change.</p><h4 id="D"><a href="#D" class="headerlink" title="D"></a>D</h4><p>A group of blue-faced birds step through the grass shoulder to shoulder, red eyes looking around. They look like middle schoolers seeking a cafeteria table at lunchtime. Perhaps they’ re not so different.<br>A new study, led by Damien Farine, an ornithologist who studies collective behaviour, shows that vulturine guinea fowls of eastern Africa, like humans, have multilevel societies. In the past, scientists assumed such social structures required a lot of brainpower. But the pea-brained guinea fowls are revealing the faults in that assumption.<br>These large birds wander across the landscape in packs, often walking so closely that their bodies touch. They may fight each other to maintain their strict hierarchies(等级制度),but at other times they engage in friendly behaviours like sharing food.<br>Suspecting the guinea fowl might have a social structure, Dr. Farine and his colleagues began a thorough study of their society. For a whole year, they made daily observations of 441 birds. Coloured leg bands in unique combinations let researchers tell the black-and-blue birds apart. They also attached GPS devices to the backs of 58 birds, which let them see exactly where every group went, 24 hours a day.<br>The findings of the research suggest that vulturine guinea fowls have a multilevel society. There are groups within groups within the population as a whole. There even seem to be groups of friends within the small groups. This is the first time anyone has observed such a society in a bird.<br>And Dr. Farine emphasizes this particular bird’s tiny brain size. “ They don’ t only have small brains relative to mammals; they also have quite small brains relative to other birds, ” he said.<br>According to him, living in this kind of society might actually make it easier to keep track of the social order. For example, if groups are stable and a bird can identify just one or two individuals within a group, it knows which group it’ s looking at — no need for a brain that can recognize every single animal. Multilevel societies also let animals adjust their group sizes based on whatever challenges they’re facing. Depending on what enemies or resources are around, it might make sense to travel in a combined group rather than a smaller one.<br>“Having a multilevel structure may not require having a large brain,” Dr. Farine said. There may be more birds and other animals out there that, although small-brained, have multilevel societies as our own.<br>32.According to the passage, what inspired Dr. Farine to carry out the study?<br>A. The guinea fowl’ s social behaviour. B. Previous assumptions about birds.<br>C. His interest in animals’ brainpower. D. The faults in earlier research.<br>33. What is Paragraph 4 mainly about?<br>A. The research subjects. B. The research methods.<br>C. The research findings. D. The research equipment.<br>34. What can be learned from the passage?<br>A. Complex social systems can be a disadvantage to guinea fowls.<br>B. Guinea fowls are good at recognizing individuals in a group.<br>C. Birds maintain the social order by travelling in combined groups.<br>D. Small-brained animals can form multilevel societies.<br>35. What is the main purpose of the passage?<br>A. To present the findings of a study of the guinea fowl.<br>B. To explain the interaction patterns in multilevel societies.<br>C. To introduce a new approach to observing the guinea fowl.<br>D. To uncover clues about how complex societies are formed.</p><h4 id="第二节-共5小题；每小题2分，满分10分"><a href="#第二节-共5小题；每小题2分，满分10分" class="headerlink" title="第二节(共5小题；每小题2分，满分10分)"></a>第二节(共5小题；每小题2分，满分10分)</h4><p>根据短文内容，从短文后的选项中选出能填入空白处的最佳选项.选项中有两项为多余选项<br>How to Handle an Anti-climax(扫兴)<br>Many of you work tirelessly towards your goals.

The hike up the lower part of Jewell was 41 . But less than an hour later, the weather was showing its teeth. Bales began to think about calling it a day. Then she noticed something: a single set of 42 in the snow ahead of her. She’ d been 43 unclear tracks all day and hadn’ t given them much 44 , because so many people climb Jewell Trail.

How long has the dryer been acting up?(15)<br>W:For two weeks now.(15)<br>M:Can you describe what’s wrong with it?<br>W: Ye:s. The clothes used to dry perfectly with $2.(16) Last week, we had to use $3 for the same amount of clothes. This week, we have to use $4.<br>M: Oh, that’s bad! Do you know which dryer it is?<br>W: Just a second… I’m almost at the laundry room.Let me see.. Ihave to remember which one is broken… Yes, here it is.It’s the fourth dryer in the row. Here’s the number. J-4-8-9-L-W.<br>M: Thank you.I’ll send Joe over this afternoon. He’ll take a spare dryer in his truck, in case he can’t fix yours.(17)I suspect that something is blocking the air flow.Anything else, ma’am?<br>W: No, that’s it. Thank you.<br>Text 10<br>When I was a little boy, my grandfather told me that our family came to America from Spain. His favorite thing to talk about was a traditional event called“the human tower” .It’s a physical challenge that’s done during the annual festivals around Barcelona.. The goal of the event is to build up layers of people to try and make a high tower.(20)The people who are on the bottom are often the largest, so that they can hold everyone else.(18) Participants stand on each other’s shoulders, so it’s important to think about who goes on each level. N Men, women and kids all participate in building the tower,(18) so there are many different ways to build. The event involves everyone in the area, too.Anyone who is not involved in building the tower has an important job, though. The audience all crowd around the tower and hold up their hands to try and break the fall of any person who loses their balance.This stops anyone in the tower from getting hurt.<br>Traditionally, the human tower has four people on each level.The world record for the largest human tower had 10 levels,(19))but the record is not why people do it.. The point is to bring the community together.(20)</p></div><div class="post-copyright-info w-full my-8 px-2 sm:px-6 md:px-8"><div class="article-copyright-info-container"><ul><li><strong>标题:</strong> 高2021级英语试卷（一）</li><li><strong>作者:</strong> 晨曦</li><li><strong>创建于 :</strong> 2022-12-13 08:59:53</li><li><strong>更新于 :</strong> 2024-08-03 23:38:31</li><li><strong>链接:</strong> https://blog.xuchengxi.tk/2022/12/13/dc/高2021级英语试卷（一）/</li><li><strong>版权声明: </strong>本文章采用 <a class="license" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a> 进行许可。</li></ul></div></div><ul class="post-tags-box text-lg mt-1.5 flex-wrap justify-center flex md:hidden"><li class="tag-item mx-0.5"><a href="/tags/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/">#英语</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><div class="article-nav my-8 flex justify-between items-center px-2 sm:px-6 md:px-8"><div class="article-prev border-border-color shadow-redefine-flat shadow-shadow-color-2 rounded-medium px-4 py-2 hover:shadow-redefine-flat-hover hover:shadow-shadow-color-2"><a class="prev" rel="prev" href="/2022/12/13/dc/%E9%AB%982021%E7%BA%A7%E8%AF%AD%E6%96%87%E6%97%A9%E8%AF%BB%E8%B5%84%E6%96%99%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E5%91%A8/"><span class="left arrow-icon flex justify-center items-center"><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-left"></i> </span><span class="title flex justify-center items-center"><span class="post-nav-title-item">高2021级语文早读资料第二周</span> <span class="post-nav-item">上一篇</span></span></a></div><div class="article-next border-border-color shadow-redefine-flat shadow-shadow-color-2 rounded-medium px-4 py-2 hover:shadow-redefine-flat-hover hover:shadow-shadow-color-2"><a class="next" rel="next" href="/2022/12/12/%E5%95%8A%E8%BF%99/"><span class="title flex justify-center items-center"><span class="post-nav-title-item">啊这</span> <span class="post-nav-item">下一篇</span> </span><span class="right arrow-icon flex justify-center items-center"><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-right"></i></span></a></div></div><div class="comment-container px-2 sm:px-6 md:px-8 pb-8"><div class="comments-container mt-10 w-full"><div id="comment-anchor" class="w-full h-2.5"></div><div class="comment-area-title w-full my-1.5 md:my-2.5 text-xl md:text-3xl font-bold">评论</div><div id="waline"></div><script type="module" data-swup-reload-script>import { init } from '/js/libs/waline.mjs';
